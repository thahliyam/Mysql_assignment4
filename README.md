This assignment involves creating two SQL tables, Country and Persons, and performing several queries to extract information from them. The Country table contains fields for the country ID, name, population, and area, while the Persons table holds fields for personal information such as first and last names, population, rating, and country-related data. After inserting 10 rows into each table, the task includes running SQL queries to retrieve distinct country names, selecting names with aliases, and finding persons based on various conditions like ratings above 4.0, specific countries, or missing country names. Additionally, queries are run to find countries with populations in certain ranges and exclude countries based on their names. This assignment covers essential SQL operations like SELECT, WHERE, DISTINCT, IN, and NOT LIKE clauses, showcasing skills in data retrieval and conditional filtering.
